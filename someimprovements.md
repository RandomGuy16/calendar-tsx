Here’s some feedback on your `CourseCard.tsx` implementation:

**Strengths:**
- Good separation of concerns: Checkbox logic is split between individual sections and the "all" selector.
- Clear prop typing and use of TypeScript interfaces.
- Use of React state (`useState`) for local UI state.
- Code is well-commented and readable.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **State Synchronization Issues:**
   - In `CourseCardCheckbox`, you use local state (`stateChecked`) initialized from the `checked` prop, but if the parent updates `checked`, the local state won't update. Consider using the prop directly or syncing with `useEffect`:
     ```tsx
     useEffect(() => { setStateChecked(checked); }, [checked]);
     ```
   - Similarly, `areAllChecked` in `CourseCard` is initialized from `course.areAllSectionsSelected()`, but if the course selection changes outside this component, it may get out of sync.

2. **Optional Chaining and Non-null Assertions:**
   - You use `section!` in several places. This can be risky if `section` is ever undefined. Consider adding runtime checks or making the prop required where appropriate.

3. **Unnecessary State:**
   - If the source of truth for selection is always in `course`, you might not need local state for checkboxes at all—just derive checked state from `course`.

4. **Performance:**
   - If `course.getSections()` or `course.isSectionSelected()` are expensive, consider memoizing them.

5. **Accessibility:**
   - Add `aria-` attributes or labels to checkboxes for better accessibility.

6. **Minor:**
   - The `value={` `}` on checkboxes is unnecessary unless you have a specific reason.
   - Consider using more descriptive names for variables like `stateChecked` (e.g., `isChecked`).

**Example improvement for state sync:**

```tsx
const [stateChecked, setStateChecked] = useState(checked);
useEffect(() => {
  setStateChecked(checked);
}, [checked]);
```

**Summary:**  
The code is well-structured and functional, but you should review state synchronization between parent and child components to avoid UI inconsistencies. Also, consider accessibility improvements and reducing unnecessary state where possible.
